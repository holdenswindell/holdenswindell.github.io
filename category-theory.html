		<h2>Category Theory at UW-Madison</h2>
		<p>The category theory reading group was started in the December of 2023 and is active today. We have directed reading, discussion of papers, and talks throughout the semester.</p>
		<p>This semester, the directed reading text is Tom Leinster's <em>Basic Category Theory</em>, which is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375">here</a>. We meet for directed reading on Sundays at 2:30 PM in Van Vleck Hall B227.</p>
		<p>We have planned several talks this semester on subjects related to category theory, including abelian categories, pointless topology, and the fundamental groupoid. Times and locations will be announced later on in the semester, so stay tuned.</p>
		<p>If you are interested in joining the group, please contact me using the information <a href="about.html">here</a>.
